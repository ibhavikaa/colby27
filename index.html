                            I have stories to share. I come from a place where the winds of culture blow from three directions, where the colors, scents and sounds mix to create a unique mosaic of traditions. I grew up on the border of Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab, right where their cultures intermingle to create a tapestry of diversity. When I come to Colby, I’ll bring with me the unique myths and legends I grew up hearing, ones that you will only hear in the confines of those 30 or so miles on the border in North India. I would love to share these with my peers on outing trips and in everyday conversations.

                        I'm not scared of asking the important questions. My bestie’s parents received an arranged marriage proposal for her in 7th grade. Mine did in 9th grade. Why is it that while Mary Low graduated college in 1850, some women cannot do so even in the 21st century? Why is it that my family would only see their Mary Low in 2027? I seek to learn from my peers and engage in productive dialog that helps progress issues that matter.

                        I have a talent for finding the best dorm room snacks (and hacks), and I'm willing to clue people in. This means no complaints from my roommate. Ever.

                        My work experience in computer science, including internships like FishialAI and leadership roles at charity organizations like SaySmile make me a strong candidate for the computer science program at Colby. Academically, I have completed multiple coding and specialized tech courses and bootcamps which have served as additional resources and helped me practice my skills.

                        I’m a night owl so 4 PM sunsets don’t scare me and winters for me are a piece of cake (the trick is to keep eating pieces of cake till you form a layer of fat thick enough to hide your secretly shaking bones)

                        My compass always points north towards my core values, and my moral compass is no exception. With every decision, big or small, my inner voice nudges me towards the path of personal integrity. My unwavering commitment to doing what is right would allow me to stand firmly on the foundation of honesty, transparency and respect as I am exposed to an entirely different environment than that in high-school.

                        As the Co-Founder of our school’s first girls only coding club, I have acquired adequate experience in helping girls navigate the tech space while creating a warm and welcoming environment. The experience will help me be a similarly helpful figure in Colby’s WiMaCS club.

                    <p>
                        I am eager to explore different cultures. Over the last year, I have been learning Spanish so that I can use my skills to have an immersive experience during study abroad in college. I am ready for the global experiences that Colby aims to provide to its students and am enthusiastic to engage with distinct perspectives that prepare me for the globalized world.

                    <p>
                        I value my independence in thought and action. Once I have set my goals, I work tirelessly to achieve them. I ask questions, I challenge my assumptions, I learn and I go the extra mile if I have to. Colby expects its students to be independent thinkers and empowered individuals and if there is one thing I like to do, it is to blaze my own trail.

                        My life hasn’t been constant— I have failed and failed again. The only thing that has remained constant is my strength to get back up every time I fall. Colby is an academically challenging school where I am expected to fail but you can rest assured that any time I do so, I will persevere, I will adapt, but I will not give up.

                        I have a knack for spotting bugs— both in code and in the wild. I’m the go-to person for a hiking partner and would make a proud and active member of the Colby Outing Club.

                        I am keen to dive deeper into the field of Human-Computer Interaction which draws on a range of other disciplines like sociology, philosophy, psychology, computer science and design. My varied interests form a perfect match with Colby’s liberal arts curriculum that values and rewards interdisciplinary learning.

                        I promise to serve my A+ fashion game even in subzero temperatures (mainly because I fall asleep when I wear comfy clothes to class). Look no further if Colby needs a little color for the white winter!

                        As the founder of A Pinch of Self-Love, I have a thorough understanding of the importance of mental health and wellness. I am committed to taking care of myself and those around me. I hope to be a supportive presence on campus and help reduce the stigma around mental health.

                        I relish the challenge of unraveling intricate theories and scrutinizing multifaceted concepts. At Colby, I will take pleasure in dissecting complex ideas and sparking up thought-provoking conversations with professors and marvel at scientific details with my friends.

                        My life is a symphony, and my schedule is the conductor. I carefully devise excel sheets that allow me to manage my time and resources to make sure I meet all of my commitments with ease. So you can count on me for being diligent in all the work I do at Colby, both academically and otherwise.

                        Having lived in a small town all my life, I would feel at home with the pace and lifestyle of Colby's campus. I am familiar with the rhythms of a close-knit community and I will bring this positive spirit with me to college. On days when my peers feel not so jolly, I will lift their spirits :)

                        I find pleasure in setting up an aesthetically pleasing table before studying. I will continue to do so in the Miller Library so Colby gets those brownie points from parents and prospective students on tour. Anything for you!

                        Be it organizing  sports meets and science fairs as House Captain, spearheading my team at the RoundPier Summer Programme or leading over 50 volunteers at Parvaah, I have consistently used my innate ability to inspire and guide others to make an impact. I believe that my leadership skills could be a meaningful asset at Colby, one that fosters collaboration and empowers others.

                        I have been closely involved in a variety of extracurricular activities throughout my schooling. This has allowed me to become better at time management and juggling multiple responsibilities at once. At Colby, this experience would be valuable for me in handling academics, extracurriculars, work and internships, etc all at once.

                        I find comfort in embracing discomfort. My insatiable curiosity constantly pushes me into new uncharted territories. Be it in choosing the ‘un-ladylike’ subjects of math and science, in taking the ‘risk’ of a gap-year, or in leading men rather than following them— I have always been ready to take the uncommon route despite the predispositions of my orthodox community. In Colby’s environment of a wide range of activities and courses, I will be in the perfect position to utilize my strengths and flourish.

                        I take great pride in the institutions I attend and never shy away from displaying my pride in full glory. From guiding my 3rd grade classroom in Christmas room decor competitions and piloting peers in pinboard setups as Class Prefect to showing up to sports events in school colors, I spare no effort when it comes to displaying school spirit. Have no doubt on whether I will do the same for Colby, because I will– right from the moment I hear back!
